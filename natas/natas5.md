For this level, the page just says:
```html
Access disallowed. You are not logged in
```

There was no hint for where the password is. So I did some digging around. Eventually, I stumbled upon the cookies page for this website and I saw that it was storing a cookie `loggedin` with the value `0`

So when the page is first accessed, the `loggedin` cookie probably got initialized with 0. So I just changed it to 1 and reloaded the page:
```html
Access granted. The password for natas6 is fOIvE0MDtPTgRhqmmvvAOt2EfXR6uQgR
```
