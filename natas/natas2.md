Opening the instructor, we can see that there's a 1x1 image located in the `files` directory. So I decided to check the files directory: http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files

I found the image file `pixel.png` and another file called `users.txt`

`users.txt` contains the name of the users and the passwords (including natas3):
```txt
# username:password
alice:BYNdCesZqW
bob:jw2ueICLvT
charlie:G5vCxkVV3m
natas3:G6ctbMJ5Nb4cbFwhpMPSvxGHhQ7I6W8Q
eve:zo4mJWyNj2
mallory:9urtcpzBmH
```
