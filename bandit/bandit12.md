For this level, it's important to understand hexdump. The hexdump is just the binary output of a particular file. In data.txt, it contains the entire hexdump of the compressed password file. We need to first revert this hexdump as it's currently in ASCII values. We could use `xxd` to perform the hexdump reversion:

```sh
xxd -r data.txt compressed_data
```

Then we could examine the hexdump of the data and try to determine what kind of compression algorithm was used on it. We could use reference [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) or we could just use the command `file`, which automatically check for file signature. Then we could choose the appropriate file decompression tool. For this level, they used `bzip2`, `gzip`, and `tar` for compression.
