Level password: `EReVavePLFHtFlFsjn3hyzMlvSuSAcRD`

For comparing the differences between 2 files, we use `diff`:

```sh
diff passwords.old passwords.new
```

Since we put `passwords.new` in second place, the new password is also printed in the second place.

We could also use `diff -y` to see the files side by side.
